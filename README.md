# Xion Hackton - 

I'm excited to announce that I'll be publishing the architecture for the project we're planning to build for the Hackathon. Any feedback or suggestions you may have are more than welcome!

The Story: Users often find themselves in a situation where they want to purchase an expensive NFT or perform a significant swap, but they lack the required funds. In response, they open a vault smart contract on Xion that demands multiple signatures. The user deposits tokens into a smart account that will generate ICA on the Injective network, execute the swap/purchase, and then return the assets to the Xion account.
